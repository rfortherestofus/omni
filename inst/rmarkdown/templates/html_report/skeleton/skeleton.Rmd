**Guidance for this template**

\* - \* - \*

Dear OMNI-ite, In using this template, please remember to use the [OMNI
stye guide and best
practices](https://omniinstitute.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Quant/pages/198673178/R+Syntax+Best+Practices)
for writing syntax and cleaning data.

If possible and relevant, arrange for someone to review your code using
the [code review
template](https://omniinstitute.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Quant/pages/504659969/R+Code+Review+Checklist+Template)
(which can be loaded as a template from any project page in Confluence).

The next section, 'File Description', should be filled out and kept in
the document after knitting. It is important to clarify what the
document does - what it takes in as inputs - what it produces - and any
key steps or caveats that future users might need to be aware of.

## File Description {.unnumbered}

Inputs: *what does this file take in as inputs? Perhaps excel files, the
results of a survey saved in excel, some clean data saved as an rds
file. Indicate any assumptions about the file like if it is supposed to
be cleaned, stored in a certain folder, have an extension in the file
name after a certain date, etc*

Outputs: *what does the file produce? is it a cleaned version of a
dataset, is it a series of tables stored to an excel workbook? Is the
knitted rmd the 'output', along with the tables and figures that will be
generated here? Give a short description of what the intention of this
file is*

Process: *are there any key steps that need to happen within this file,
the major steps - if possible, list the major aspects of the script in a
short but clear outline*

Notes or caveats: *are there additional things that should be noted
about the script? Perhaps it is run iteratively every few months or so,
but after the first few iterations the file structure of the input file
changed and some new code chunks had to be added below to adjust.
Perhaps there is a section of the code that has to do an unusual or
highly specialized operation and some additional context could be
helpful.*

# load data

```{r}
# paramaters 
# it is often useful to define things like date ranges, or titles of files, or perhaps sample sizes, etc. 
# Any quantity, value, or label that will have to be references more than once in this document, or in future runs of this script, could be defined here and then called in the text using something like `r n_total` or `r report_name` 
# This is a very good habit to get into. Paramaterize as much as possible 
```
