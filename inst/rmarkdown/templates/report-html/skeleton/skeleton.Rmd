Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Lorem Ipsum is simply [dummy text]{.plum-200}

[Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text]{.olive-green-400}

Lorem [Ipsum]{.orange-red-600} is simply dummy text.

## Additional Design Elements

Again, to see how these are made, take a look at the R Markdown document.

#### Number Emphasis

```{r, echo=FALSE}
number_emphasis(
  number = 1234,
  text = "pt. Inter Tight for stats numbers. 12 pt Inter Tight for stats content.",
  color = "teal-400",
)
```


#### Icon Text Grid

```{r, echo=FALSE}
width_px <- 50
icon_color_fg <- "white"
icon_color_bg <- 'teal-600'

icon_text_grid(
  omni_icon('education', width_px, icon_color_bg, icon_color_fg),
  icon_text(
    text = '**71.9%:** Any person younger than 21 caught with or suspected of consuming alcohol or marijuana is charged with Minor in Possession (MIP).'
  ),
  omni_icon('security', width_px, icon_color_bg, icon_color_fg),
  icon_text(
    '**69.8%:** Adults in Colorado who knowingly hep someone younger than 18 break the law - which includes providing minors with alcohol or drubgs - can be charged with a Class 4 felony.'
  ),
  omni_icon('vault', width_px, icon_color_bg, icon_color_fg),
  icon_text(
    '**34.4%:** It is legal for a person ages 18-20 to possess marijuana with a medical marijuana card.'
  ),
  width_px = width_px
)
```
