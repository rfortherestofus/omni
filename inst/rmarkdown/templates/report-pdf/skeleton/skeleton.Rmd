## Introduction

This is a very minimal example! The only thing which is changed in this template is a few of the default settings in the YAML. 

## Customisation

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    echo = FALSE,
    fig.topcaption = TRUE,
    fig.cap = TRUE,
    dpi = 150
)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(omni)
```
