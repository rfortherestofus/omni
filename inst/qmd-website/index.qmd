This is a Quarto website template, made for the [Omni Institute](https://www.omni.org/).

It's based on Omni branding and is intended to be easy to customize using Quarto.

By default, it contains 3 pages:

- [Home](./index.qmd): the page you're currently in
- [Use this template](./about.qmd): a short tutorial on how to use this website template
- [Customization](./customization.qmd): a list of nice customizations you can make with Quarto, and how to do them
