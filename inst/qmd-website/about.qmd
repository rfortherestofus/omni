This is a Quarto website template, made for the [Omni Institute](https://www.omni.org/).

## Create a new website

The `{omni}` package contains a `create_website()` function that will create a new directory (named `my_report` in the example below) with default files to get you started.

```r
library(omni)

create_website("my_report")
```

Once you created the new directory, it'll open the main Quarto page, named `index.qmd`. Hit the `Render` button and you should be able to preview your website.
