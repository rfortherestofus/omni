This is a Quarto website template, made for the [Omni Institute](https://www.omni.org/).

## Create a new website

The `{omni}` package contains a `create_website()` function that will create a new directory (named `my_report` in the example below) with default files to get you started.

```r
library(omni)

create_website("my_report")
```

Once you created the new directory, it'll open the main Quarto page, named `index.qmd`. Hit the `Render` button and you should be able to preview your website.


## Add or remove a page

To add/remove a page, you must do two things:

- Create (or delete) the page you want to add (or remove). By default, the website has three pages: `index.qmd`, `customization.qmd` and `about.qmd`. Let's say we want to add an "Appendix" page, we create an `appendix.qmd` file next to other Quarto documents.
- Add (or remove) the page to `_quarto.yml` configuration file. Default `_quarto.yml` looks like this:

```yaml
website:
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - href: about.qmd
        text: Use this template
      - href: customization.qmd
        text: Customization
```

We can add our Appendix page by adding:

```yaml
- href: appendix.qmd
  text: Appendix
```

This gives us:

The `href` attribute above should match exactly the name of the file you created, while the `text` attribute can be whatever you want since it's just what will be in the navigation bar.
