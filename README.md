# omni

This package contains a set of internal functions and templates for Omni
Institute. An overview of the functions can be found on the [reference
page](reference/). Long-form documentation of how the package works can be found
on the [R @ Omni website](https://ratomni.netlify.app/).

*This template was created for the Omni Institute, a Colorado-based
nonprofit social science consultancy that provides integrated research
and evaluation, capacity building, and data utilization services to
accelerate positive social change. If you are interested in adapting
this OMNI branded template please contact <omni@omni.org>.*
