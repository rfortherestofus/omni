# omni

This package contains an [RMarkdown template](articles/rmarkdown.html),
[color palettes](articles/colors.html), a [ggplot2
theme](articles/theme.html), and a [function to make
tables](articles/tables.html) for OMNI Institute.

*This template was created for the OMNI Institute, a Colorado-based
nonprofit social science consultancy that provides integrated research
and evaluation, capacity building, and data utilization services to
accelerate positive social change. If you are interested in adapting
this OMNI branded template please contact <omni@omni.org>.*

package.

## Rebrand in Progress

We are currently working on updating this package to match OMNI's rebrand. If
you want to test the in-progress "rebrand" version of the package, you can do it
with the following code:

remotes::install_github("rfortherestofus/omni", force = TRUE, ref = "rebrand")
